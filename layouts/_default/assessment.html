                What is a psychological assessment and how are they useful?
              </h4>
              <p>
                A typical reason for obtaining a psychological assessment is to
                determine if you meet diagnostic criteria for a specific
                learning disorder, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, or
                other mental health condition. Formal assessments are sometimes
                required to access to services and/or specialized resources that
                require a formal diagnostic assessment by a psychologist or
                physician. Some people require a psychological assessment to
                support accomodations at work or school. Evidence-based
                recommendations for treatment and self-guided strategies for
                symptom management are also provided.

              <h4>What do psychological assessments typically involve?</h4>
              <p>
                Assessments are uniquely tailored to each individual but most
                include:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> an interview to
                  understand your current symptoms and difficulties, when they
                  started, and how they are impacting your quality of life and
                  day-to-day functioning
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> one or more symptom-based
                  questionnaires or specialized diagnostic tests
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> if possible, interviews
                  with family members and review of school and medical records,
                  with your written consent
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                After the assessment is completed you can expect to receive:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> a detailed report with a
                  summary of the information collected, diagnostic conclusions,
                  and recommendations, including recommendations for academic or
                  workplace accomodations, evidence-based treatments, and
                  strategies for self-management
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>a feedback session with
                  the assessing psychologist by phone or video to discuss the
                  report and answer any questions you may have
