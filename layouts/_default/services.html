                provide a focused snapshot of current symptoms and functioning,
                personal strengths, areas of difficulty, recommendations for
                treatment and self-management are included in a comprehensive
                psychological report, as well as recommendations for academic

                <br />
                Assessments often typically involve determining if you meet
                criteria for a mental health diagnosis as part of a workplace or
                educational accommodation process, or to guide treatment
                planning.

                <a href="/services/treatment/">Psychological treatment </a>
                typically involves time-limited, recurring appointments with a
                psychologist in the service of a specific personal goal, either
                reducing symptoms of anxiety or depression, processing traumatic
                events, improving relationships, or overcoming other
                difficulties in order to live your best life. One-on-one therapy
                services are typically covered by insurance and some group
                therapy options are in planning as well.
